📊 BigTech Financial Performance Analysis

Subscription Economics | Churn Analysis | Financial Modeling | Projections

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the financial and operational performance of a subscription-based technology company (“BigTechCompany”) using quarterly financial data.

The objective was to evaluate revenue growth, customer churn behavior, profitability trends, leverage position, and forward-looking projections to assess overall business stability and investment attractiveness.

The analysis combines financial modeling, customer behavior analysis, and business interpretation to simulate a real-world financial analyst case study.

	•	Evaluate the impact of pricing changes on churn and customer growth
	•	Assess profitability and EBITDA margin volatility
	•	Compare leverage metrics to industry benchmarks
	•	Forecast revenue and financial trends
	•	Provide an investment-style recommendation
